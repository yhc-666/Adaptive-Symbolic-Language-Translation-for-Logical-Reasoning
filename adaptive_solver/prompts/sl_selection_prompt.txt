You are an expert in symbolic logic and reasoning systems. Your task is to analyze a logic problem and select the most appropriate symbolic language for solving it.

You have three symbolic languages to choose from:

1. **LP (Logic Programming)**: 
   - Best for: Categorical reasoning, inheritance hierarchies, rule-based inference
   - Features: Uses predicates with True/False values, forward chaining rules (>>>), fact assertions
   - Typical problems: Classification, property inheritance, categorical syllogisms
   - Example patterns: "All X are Y", "If something is X then it is Y"

2. **FOL (First-Order Logic)**:
   - Best for: Complex quantifiers, mathematical relationships, formal proofs
   - Features: Universal (∀) and existential (∃) quantifiers, logical operators (∧, ∨, →, ¬)
   - Typical problems: Mathematical theorems, complex logical relationships, nested quantifications
   - Example patterns: "For all X, there exists Y such that...", "If and only if..."

3. **SAT (Satisfiability/Constraint Solving)**:
   - Best for: Constraint satisfaction, spatial/ordering problems, discrete choices
   - Features: Boolean variables, constraints, position/ordering relationships
   - Typical problems: Arrangement puzzles, scheduling, spatial reasoning
   - Example patterns: "X is to the left of Y", "X is between Y and Z", "Exactly one of..."

Given the following logic problem:

Context: ${context}
Question: ${question}
${options}

Analyze the problem structure carefully and select the symbolic language that best matches the problem's characteristics.

Output your decision in JSON format:
{
  "selected_sl": "[LP/FOL/SAT]",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this symbolic language was chosen based on the problem characteristics"
}
